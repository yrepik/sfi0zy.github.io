Muilessium is my pet project - UI framework for static websites. 40+ components, 60+ utilities to make code cleaner, LESS+RSCSS, fluid typography, keyboard and touchscreen support, understandable and well-organized code. The main purpose of its development is to create simple, but powerful framework for landings, personal websites, blogs, etc. This week I created a first beta-version of it and I think I'll release it soon. Docs for the current version are available <a href='https://sfi0zy.github.io/muilessium/'>here</a>.
