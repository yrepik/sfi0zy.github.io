    <div class='mui-post-content' itemprop='description'>
        <p class='mui-p'>Hello! I'm Ivan Bogachev. I'm a UI developer, a man experienced in modern front-end technologies with an education in computer science, music and drawing arts. I have no degrees, I'm a self-taught person. I prefer to think that I'm not a "designer that knows html", I'm a "programmer with design skills".</p>

<p class='mui-p'>One of my strengths is ability to create amazing effects using JS, SVG and modern CSS. Some examples are published on this site and you can take a look on sources for free. Also, I share my knowledge by writing articles on Habrahabr and answering the questions on Toster (it's like StackOverflow, but in Russian).</p>

        <p class='mui-p'>My hobby is music. I've been playing guitar for many years and last year I wrote a book about the most popular flamenco forms. Also, I play piano a little and compose music for a chamber orchestra. This year I published two collections of my pieces for piano and for piano and violin. Flamenco and classical music aren't very popular today, but I like this music and continue to play it no matter what.</p>

<p class='mui-p'>I have some health problems. My illness called schizotypal disorder. Due this problem I can't work all day as healthy people and now I'm looking for a part-time job in Moscow. If you need an experienced UI developer to create websites with complex layouts and incredible effects, we could meet and discuss your vacancy.</p>
